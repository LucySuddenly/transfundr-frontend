# TransFundr - Frontend

This is the frontend for the [TransFundr website](www.transfundr.com). TransFundr is a crowdfunding website for trans women -- what makes this app unique is a point system, offering points in exchange for donations, which you can show off on your profile page as a user who donates.

## Motivation

From the About page of the site: TransFundr was built by a white trans woman to facilitate and reward donations to struggling trans women, especially trans women of color. Trans women are at high risk of joblessness, homelessness, assault, and societal exclusion. The risks are especially compounded for trans women of color, with most violent assaults being directed at them. Point multipliers reflect these realities, encouraging donations to flow to trans women of color. Sort methods also prioritize trans women of color ahead of white trans women.
